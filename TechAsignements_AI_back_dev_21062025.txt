Assignment 1: AI-driven Document Insight Service
Description
Build a Python-based REST API (FastAPI or Flask) that:
    • Ingests PDF or image documents (e.g., scanned contracts, invoices) and extracts text (via EasyOCR, PyMuPDF, or both, or other – choose to demonstrate).
    • Answers user questions about the uploaded documents using a QA model (e.g., DistilBERT QA or any other transformer, local or any LLM via API).
    • Find or create random/dummy test docs (store in Github repo).
Core Requirements
    • POST /upload: accept one or more documents, store them for session-based or user-based retrieval.
    • POST /ask: take a question, run a QA pipeline over the stored documents, and return the answer.
    • Dockerize the entire application.
Optional Enhancements (pick at least one)
    • Integrate Named Entity Recognition (choose model) to highlight entities in responses.
    • Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with embeddings (FAISS or similar) for improved context retrieval.
    • Add a caching layer (Redis or other) to store and quickly fetch document embeddings.
General Optional Enhancements (pick any)
    • UI: Prototype with Gradio or Streamlit to demonstrate the workflow.
    • MLOps: Modular packaging, CI/CD integration, structured logging, monitoring.
    • Performance: Profile model inference latency or API throughput and optimize.
    • Security: JWT authentication, input sanitization, rate limiting.
ChatGPT/LLM Usage
You may use ChatGPT or any LLM to accelerate development. Just be ready to explain how you validated AI-generated code, and why you chose the final approach.
Delivery
Host your solution in a GitHub repository. Your README.md must include:
    • Setup instructions
    • Manual installation and Docker option instructions
    • Example API requests and responses
    • Brief description of your approach (tools/models chosen and why)
    • Optional: screenshots, demo video, or other creative additions
Any extra creative feature beyond the above is a big plus. Show us your ingenuity!
